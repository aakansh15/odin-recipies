      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Maggi noodles are an instant noodle brand produced by Nestl√©. They are
        popular in many countries around the world, but especially in India,
        where they are often referred to as "Maggi" or "2-minute noodles".
      </p>
      <p>
        The noodles are made from wheat flour, palm oil, and spices. They are
        typically cooked in boiling water for 2 minutes, and then served with a
        flavor packet. Maggi noodles come in a variety of flavors, including
        masala, chicken, and tomato.
