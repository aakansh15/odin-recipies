    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Maggi noodles are an instant noodle brand produced by Nestlé. They are
      popular in many countries around the world, but especially in India, where
      they are often referred to as "Maggi" or "2-minute noodles".
    </p>
    <p>
      The noodles are made from wheat flour, palm oil, and spices. They are
      typically cooked in boiling water for 2 minutes, and then served with a
      flavor packet. Maggi noodles come in a variety of flavors, including
      masala, chicken, and tomato.
